# URLockBox

    URLockbox is a small application for tossing various forms of inspiration for later review. It's not unlike Delicious or Pinboard. It is the spiritual successor of Ideabo.

The URLockbox is a starter app for the mid-module assessment for backend engineering module4 at TuringSchool of Software and Design.
