# URLockBox

<p> URLockbox is a small application for tossing various forms of inspiration for later review. It's not unlike Delicious or Pinboard. It is the spiritual successor of Ideabo.</p>

<p>The idea behind is to allow authenticated users to login, write down their titles and links, so it can be used in the future as a reference.</p>
